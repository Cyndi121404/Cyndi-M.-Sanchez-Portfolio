        <h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹, I Am Cyndi M. Sanchez</h1>
        <Span>
        <p>I'm a passionate Computer Science major at Kingâ€™s College with 
          a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and 
          full-stack web technologies. I specialize in building scalable, 
          user-focused applications using Java, JavaScript, SQL, and 
          Microsoft Azure. Whether developing immersive text-based games 
          or architecting backend systems, I bring precision, creativity, 
          and strategic thinking to every project. As a representative in 
          both Student Government and the Coding Club, as well as an active 
          member of the Engineering Club, I'm driven by curiosity, collaboration, 
          and the desire to make a meaningful impact through code.</p>

<span id="Courses">
  <h2> Relevant Courses </h2>
  <h3><b>Computer Organization & Digital Design</b></h3>
  <p>| C, RISC-V ASSEMBLY, Verilog, Circuit Design |</p>
  &nbsp
  <p> â€¢ This course introduced me to how data is organized and stored in 
    computer systems. I implemented fundamental data structures such as 
    lists, stacks, queues, and trees, while also learning key concepts in 
    algorithm design and analysis. These skills helped me understand how 
    to write efficient code for real-world applications in both scientific 
    and business settings.</p>

  <h3><b>Advanced Data Structures</b></h3>
  <p>| Java |</p>
  &nbsp
  <p> â€¢ This course introduced me to how data is organized and stored in 
    computer systems. I implemented fundamental data structures such as 
    lists, stacks, queues, and trees, while also learning key concepts in 
    algorithm design and analysis. These skills helped me understand how 
    to write efficient code for real-world applications in both scientific 
    and business settings.</p>

  <h3><b>Database Management Systems</b></h3>
  <p>| SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API's |</p>
  &nbsp
  <p> â€¢ In this course, I learned how to design, build, and interact with 
    databases. I explored relational modeling, normalization, and query 
    languages like SQL, and gained experience using programming APIs to 
    connect applications to databases. As a final project, I designed a 
    custom database and developed an application that actively uses it.</p>

  <h3><b>Data Structures</b></h3>
  <p>| Java |</p>
  &nbsp
  <p> â€¢ I gained insight into how data is stored and managed within a 
    computer. I implemented core data structures such as stacks, queues, 
    lists, and trees, while also learning how to evaluate algorithm 
    efficiency. These concepts gave me a solid foundation for developing 
    effective and scalable software solutions.</p>

  <h3><b>Oriented Software Development</b></h3>
  <p>| Java |</p>
  &nbsp
  <p> â€¢ This course deepened my understanding of object-oriented 
    programming and how it's applied in larger software projects. 
    I worked with concepts like class structure, inheritance, interfaces, 
    and exception handling, while also improving my code through 
    refactoring. I gained practical experience with version control tools 
    and development workflows used in real-world programming environments.</p>

        <h3><b>Computer Programming</b></h3>
        <p>| Python |</p>
        &nbsp
        <p> â€¢ In this course, I learned the fundamentals of programming with 
          a focus on problem-solving and design. I practiced writing 
          algorithms, using control structures, and working with functions, 
          lists, and dictionaries. I also gained experience with input/output 
          and reading and writing files, which helped me build a solid 
          foundation in programming.</p>
